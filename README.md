# Easy Annotating
***Easy Annotating*** is a compilation of the different libraries using Whisper Open AI models for Speech2Text. It 
allows to generate subtitles for the audio files and depict text divided segment-by-segment, word-by-word or 
particle-by-particle using generated timestamps to console or other service for audio annotation tasks. Also, 
***Easy Annotating*** can perform zero-shot prediction of the audio on divided segments with no training.
